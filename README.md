# SherryAnalytics / Rain

A personal repo that contains my machine-learning coursework, a data diary, and side projects.

## What goes where

- **`ml/`** — Course materials for my machine learning class: homework, project code, and class notes.
- **`diary/`** — Casual, chronological notes and writeups about things I learn day-to-day.
  - Use `diary/notes/` for short entries (dated filenames help).
  - Use `diary/posts/` for longer, polished writeups.
  - Keep runnable examples in `diary/examples/` and images in `diary/images/`.
- **`projects/`** — Longer-term or stand-alone projects (examples: wealth tracker, clustering experiments).
- **`README.md`** — This file: quick explanation and navigation.

## Naming & conventions (suggested)
- Diary note filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md` (e.g. `2025-11-13-python-vs-devops.md`)
- Notebooks: store in the relevant project folder and add a short `.md` readme describing how to run them.
- Keep images in the matching `images/` folder and reference them with relative paths.

## How to contribute / add entries
1. Create or edit files in the appropriate folder.
2. Follow the naming convention for diary notes.
3. Add images to the `images/` folder and reference them from markdown.
4. Commit and push to GitHub.

If you want, I can:
- create a starter diary entry (`2025-11-13-python-vs-devops.md`) for you,
- or generate the actual file tree as a zip you can download.
Which would you like?
