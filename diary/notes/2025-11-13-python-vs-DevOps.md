# 📘 Data Diary — Python vs. Python DevOps

A coworker who recently returned to the bank after retirement last year asked me a question:  
**“Should I request access to *Python* or *Python DevOps*?”**  
He’s never used Python before, so the difference wasn’t obvious.

## 🧠 The simple explanation

### 🐍 Python  
This is the programming language itself.  
It’s what we use every day for things like:

- building data pipelines  
- cleaning and transforming data  
- running analyses  
- general scripting and automation  

Basically, all the usual data work.

### ⚙️ Python DevOps  
Yes, it still uses Python — but for a **totally different purpose**.  
It’s focused on:

- automating deployments  
- CI/CD processes  
- managing servers  
- cloud infrastructure tasks  

So it’s really part of the DevOps (I call it IT) world, not data analytics or data science.

## ✅ So what should he request?

Since he’s doing data work and just getting started, the right setup is simply:

- **Python**
- **An IDE of his choice** (like VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

He doesn’t need anything labeled *Python DevOps*.
